## Good engineering discipline makes genome engineering tractable
  - All DNA features live in one genomic coordinate system
  - Automate for consistent, reproducible analysis
  - Every base pair counts, but some count more than others
  - Capture know-how in source code
  - Data visualisations vital for understanding
